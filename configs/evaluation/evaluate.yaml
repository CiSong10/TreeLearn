paths:
  pred_forest_path: 'data/pipeline/L1W/results/full_forest/L1W.laz' # path to predicted forest point cloud
  gt_forest_path: 'data/benchmark/L1W_voxelized01_for_eval.laz' # path to ground truth forest point cloud

thresholds:
  min_iou_for_match: 0.5 # minimumn pointwise iou between predicted and ground truth tree for hungarian matching (>> 0 required to prevent zero iou matching)
  min_precision_for_oversegmentation: 0.5 # maximum over all i of precision(prediction, ground_truth_i) must be larger than min_precision_for_oversegmentation for an unmatched prediction to count as oversegmentation
  # Otherwise it might just be a separate tree prediction (maybe a smaller tree) that was not annotated in the ground truth.
  min_recall_for_undersegmentation: 0.5 # maximum over all i of recall(prediction_i, ground_truth) must be larger than min_recall_for_undersegmentation for an unmatched ground truth to count as undersegmentation
  # Otherwise it might just be a tree that was not predicted at all. This is a more fine-grained distinction that was not made in the paper, but might be interesting to have.
