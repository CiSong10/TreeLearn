sample_generation:
  voxel_size: 0.1 # downsampling of input point cloud so that there is only one point left within a cube of size voxel_size x voxel_size x voxel_size
  search_radius_features: ~ # search radius to compute local geometry features of a point (not used in the paper), set to ~ if no features should be calculated
  inner_edge: 8 # only needed or tile generation and not for random crops. Designates the inner area to be used for making predictions
  outer_edge: 11 # only needed or tile generation and not for random crops. Designates the outer area which is used as context
  stride: 0.5 # only needed or tile generation and not for random crops. Designates the stride of the inner square. If set to 1, the tiles are generated without overlap. Smaller numbers lead to overlap.

  # sample generator args
  sample_generator: # arguments for statistical and neighbor based filtering of point cloud. For details: http://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/tutorial/Advanced/pointcloud_outlier_removal.html
